## 5.3 Getting Started with Python Libraries

### A Library?

A library is usually a collection of books or is a room where many books are stored so that we can read them when we want. 

In the world of programming we use the term ‘library’ to mean a similar thing. A library in the context of programming, is a collection of pre-complied codes that can be used in the programs that you write. These codes help you to get some specific and well-defined sub-tasks done. 

You can use them whenever you want, repeatedly. They make your programs much less complicated and save your time on repeating the same thing over and over.

### What is a Python Library

A python library is a collection of what we identify as modules. In simple terms, a Python module is a set of lines of code written for specific purpose. You can get some specific task done using a given module. You can use these modules repeatedly in Python programs without having to rewrite the same code at each usage. This makes your life easier as a programmer. 

The libraries are made publicly available for anyone to use. So if someone runs into a problem or identifies an error with the library that person can report about it. In that way, the problem can be easily fixed in the original library, so that everyone using it can get the correct and expected output. Essentially, the libraries and modules are shared resources.

### Using Python Libraries

Say, we need to find the square root of a number. How would we do this in Python? We can use the exponentiation operator (which is the double asterisk) and raise the given number to the power 1/2. That will give you the square root of the number. In the left hand side you see that method.

On the other hand, you can use the built-in ‘math’ module in Python to do the same thing. That is what you see on the right side. In that case, first you have to import the module ‘math’ using the reserved word ‘import’. Then you can call the ‘sqrt’ function which is part of the math module. That way, you don’t actually have to write the logic of calculating the square root of the number. It is just a matter of importing the module and calling the function. 

The math module itself has many other such functions to make calculations much easier. Then there are many other such useful libraries and modules available in Python.

### Python Standard Library

Python’s standard library has built-in modules that provide access to basic system functionality like inputs and outputs, network access and so on. The standard library consists of more than 200 core modules  which provide convenient access to the main functionalities of the Python environment. 

All the capabilities that are supported by the standard library contributes towards making Python what we call a high-level language. To use a high-level language, we do not need to have in-depth details of what is happening at each action. A high-level languages provides a convenient and easy to use interface for the programmer to get the required task done. The math library we saw in the previous example is from the Python standard library. 

### Common Python Libraries

There are wide variety of libraries available for Python. They make Python a powerful tool.

Python libraries provide us with a vibrant set of capabilities. Developing nice graphical User Interfaces for the applications, working with numbers, working with data, develop prediction models are only few of such capabilities. 

**GUI Libraries**

PyQT5 and Tkinter are two popular GUI libraries. PyQT5 is actually a visual framework that allows drag and drop of GUI components like Buttons, Labels, Text Boxes etc. As such it provides a convenient framework for GUI development. Tkinter is also popular for developing desktop applications.

**Numerical/Scientific Computing**

Numpy is a vastly popular Python library for numerical computations. It consists of a wide collection of built-in mathematical functions to make the complex calculations more efficient. Numpy can deal with large and multi-dimensional datasets.

Scipy is a well-known Python library for scientific computations. It actually uses Numpy for numerical calculations and on top of that provides modules to represent scientific concepts.  Some of the capabilities include statistical modelling and signal processing techniques.

**Working with Data**

Matplotlib is a popular Python library for plotting. It provides a wide range of capabilities for plotting numerical data. Some of the graphical representations include graphs, pie charts, histograms and scatter plots. It is a very useful tool when working with data especially for different kinds of visualisations.

Pandas library enables data manipulation and analysis. This library is especially helpful when managing large and unstructured datasets. Pandas provides data structures and operations to manage data. 

**Machine Learning**

Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence are hot topics currently in the field of mathematics and computer science. The basis of such techniques are statistical models. 

You will get introduced to these cutting edge technologies as you progress in this programme. Python ecosystem provides a wide range of capabilities in this line of work. Sci-Kit Learn and Tensorflow are only two common Python Libraries which support Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

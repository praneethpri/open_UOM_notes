### Techniques of Writing Readable Code

Following are the five techniques which can be utilized for making a codebase more readable.

1. Using meaningful names
2. Write functions that does one thing (Single Responsibility Functions)
3. Avoiding deep nesting
4. Avoiding copying and pasting code
5. Commenting responsibly

These are selected out of many since these techniques compose the basics of writing readable code and they are simple to understand. Developers adhering to these techniques would be able to achieve significant code readability.

In Part 3, the last three techniques will be discussed in detail.

### Scenario: Lending a Book in an Online Library Management System

In structured programming, when one programming construct such as IF, While etc. is included inside another programming construct, it’s named as nesting.

The sample on the left has a nested IF-ELSE structure. The other has a nested WHILE structure. It doesn’t have to be the same programming construct. A mix of programming constructs such as IF-ELSE, WHILE Loop, SWITCH-CASE, FOR Loop in a nested setting as well. 

Nesting is considered as an anti-pattern as a nested programing structure is hard to read and understand due to the hierarchical nature of the structure. If the structure goes beyond three levels, this is known as deep nesting.

### Avoid Deep Nesting: Extracting Functions

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7a91ef0691.png)

Let’s have a look at the original version of the lend_book function. Based on the understanding developed on what nesting is, it’s evident that this function has three levels of nesting.

Although technically, deep nesting is where nesting levels increase 3, this case is also a good example for how lack of readability is there due to nesting.

In Part 2, we segmented this function in to smaller functions with single responsibility. Following is the improved version.

This version of the lend_book function has reduced one level of nesting. This is achieved by extracting methods, which is one of the techniques of breaking down a nested structure.

### Avoid Deep Nesting: Simplification

Extracting functions doesn’t breakdown the nested code entirely. A good example is the _is_member_eligible_for_lending function that was extracted.

While implementing its responsibility of checking if the member is eligible for lending, it has a nested IF-ELSE structure with two levels. To remove this level of nesting, a slightly advanced programming technique is required to remove this level of nesting. Let’s have a look at this function to understand things in more details.

### Flow Diagram: Is Member Eligible for Lending

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7a9728bd05.png)

This flow diagram represents the logic for is_member_eligible_for_lending function.

The function decides that the user is eligible for lending if both conditions are true. In other words, IF the user is a member AND the user has 2 or less than two books to return THEN the user is considered eligible. In this case, the function returns True.

But if any of the conditions fail, the user is deemed not eligible for lending. In other words, IF either the user is not a member OR the user has more than 2 books to return, THEN the user is marked as not eligible for lending. The function returns False.

### Is Member Eligible for Lending: Further Simplification

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7a9a2c0ce7.png)

Let’s simplify the logic even further

.

The user is marked eligible for lending ONLY IF both conditions are True. In other words, IF the User is a Member AND Member has 2 or less than 2 books to return then the user is eligible for lending. Notice the logical AND condition at play here which allows to validate if both conditions become true to mark the user as eligible.

If the user is NOT a member, then the user is not eligible irrespective of whether the user has more than two books or not. Which means, the second condition has no effect on the result if the User is not a member.

Same goes if the user has more than two books to be returned. If that’s the case, the user is not eligible irrespective of whether the user is a member or not.

In summary, since the logic involves a logical AND, if one condition becomes false, the result becomes false irrespective of what the other condition turns out to be.

Thinking backwards, this property can be used to redesign logic. We will first validate if any of the conditions are FALSE and if so, decide that the user is not eligible.

### Is Member NOT Eligible for Lending

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7a9d82fed9.png)

Let’s try deciding whether the member is NOT eligible for lending.

As already discussed, if any of the two conditions turn out to be False, then the Member must be non-eligible for lending. This flow diagram is created based on this principle.

It has many end paths and two actions where it decides that the user is not eligible. When the member id is passed, the first validation is checked. If it fails, then immediately the logic decides that the member is not eligible, returns False and ends the function. If it passes, it goes to the next validation and continue the same pattern. This is indicated by step number 1 and step number 2.

If the flow diagram reaches step 3, it means that both the conditions has been true because otherwise, the function would have ended by now. Reaching step 3 suggests that the user is eligible.

Following are how the member eligibility function works after applying the above pattern and coding structure.

### Lend Book Function: The AWESOME Look

The same pattern can be applied to the lend_book function. Above are how this function looks.

### Never Copy-Paste Code

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7aa5ed48c4.png)

When coding, there are plenty of scenarios where a piece of code written earlier can be reused at a different place. In doing so, an easier option would be to copy that code snippet and paste where the functionality is required. A good example is the return date calculation function in the Library Management System.

Although this is easier, this opens a different set of problems which would affect the team’s productivity and code’s readability in the long run.

### Problems in Copying and Pasting Code

1. A change to the copied code must applied to all the places where the code was copied and pasted
2. Lose track of where we copied code to
3. Copying code without understanding what the code does
4. Make the codebase grow unnecessarily
5. Decreases code readability

### Proper Method of Reusing Code: Extract Reusable Functions

![](https://open.uom.lk/pluginfile.php/4584/mod_hvp/content/22/images/file-61f7aa99c124d.png)

As done in Part2, any reusable code snippet can be extracted into a function. Any consumers within the codebases of this reusable functionality can invoke this function.

Since these three lines of code is in a single point in the codebase, applying modifications and enhancements to this function is quite easy. Moreover, the effect of modifications are applied to all consumers of the function.

### Commenting Responsibly: DO s and DON’T s

### Clean Code Mindset

Although the lesion covered Readability, it’s important to understand how the other three qualities could be improved and how they are related with each other.

Maintainability means the ease of changing code. Techniques such as using self-explanatory names, extracting single responsible functions, avoid copying and pasting directly improves the ability to change code, hence Maintainability.

Extracting singly responsible functions and avoiding deep nesting also helps achieve high Testability. All the above improves Extensibility.

This is the nature of these qualities. They are interrelated. When improving one quality other qualities also improve. Consequently, if one of the qualities are degrading, the same effect can be seen on the rest of the three.

The five readability techniques discussed provides a great platform to study on the other qualities voluntarily. Following links would come in handy.

### Conclusion

This lesson explains effectiveness in avoiding nested structures, disadvantages in copying and pasting code, the right way of reusing code and guidelines on how to add comments responsibly.

The example showcases how a badly written unreadable code can be improved drastically using the above principles.

All developers must ensure these techniques are followed which would improve the readability of the code. Moreover, developers should learn how the four main qualities of a Clean Code base (Readability, Maintainability, Testability and Extensibility) are interrelated and how to improve each of these qualities.

## **4.5 Errors**

### Introduction

We can identify several types of errors that we encounter in computer programming.

**Syntax Errors** are mistakes in using the programming language. Each programming language has its own syntax and we should write them correctly.

**Runtime errors** occur when a script or a function is executing. These are sometimes referred to as Execution time errors. We will soon see some examples on these.

**Logical errors** would not generate any error messages but they would result in unexpected or erroneous output.

### Syntax Errors

Refer to the example below. We are trying to print the string ‘Hello World!’ to the console. 

So, what will happen if we run this code? It will generates a ‘Syntax Error’. We were trying to print a string value and Python was expecting single or double quotation marks. But we mistakenly had one quotation symbol missing at the end of line. Because of that, Python is complaining about a ‘Syntax Error’.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur whenever syntactically correct Python code results in errors at the run-time. There will be an error message telling us what went wrong. 

It is important to know that whenever a runtime error occurs and it is not handled properly, your Python program will terminate after that point of error. Meaning, the program will not continue to execute and you will not be able to get the expected task done. 

There are many types of runtime errors in Python.

**NameError**

A ‘NameError’ occurs when you try to reference a variable that has not been defined in the code. In the example you see a variable named ‘number’ with value 10. Then we try to print the value of a variable named ‘num’. Therefore Python is complaining about a NameError and says ‘name ‘num’ is not defined’.

**IndexError**

This error happens when we try to access a value from a sequence, but the referenced index is out of range. In this example, my_list only has three items, the index is ranging from 0 to 2. But we are trying to access the item at index 10, which is not available. That is why Python is raising an Index Error.

**Type Error**

A Type Error occurs when we try to perform an operation on variables of objects of inappropriate type. In this case we are causing a type mismatch. In the example we are trying to perform the ‘+’ operator on a string and an integer. Therefore Python is complaining that it can only concatenate (means to join) a string to string but not to any other data type (in this case an integer). 

**Value Error**

A Value Error occurs when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an invalid value. In this case we are trying to print the value of an integer but passing the string value ‘hello’ to the function ‘int’ which is invalid. That is why Python is complaining about a Value Error.

**Import Error / ModuleNotFound Error**

In this example code we are trying to import a module named ‘new_module’ which does not exist. Therefore Python is raising a Module Not Found error. Similar error could occur if you try to import something that does not exist from an existing module.

### Handling Runtime Errors

As we have discussed before, when a runtime error occurs, the program will stop immediately if the error was not handled properly. Therefore we need to plan carefully to ‘catch’ any possible errors during runtime and handle them. That way we can keep and uninterrupted execution of our program. 

**The try/except Structure**

The try/except structure helps us to handle possible runtime errors. It does not mean that we can prevent the errors. Instead it creates a safe passage for the program in the case of runtime error. 

We can basically identify two blocks (try and except) in this structure. We can put the so called ‘dangerous code’ into the try block. That means you are anticipating an error in that section of the code. In the case where the error actually occurs, the program jumps to the except block and executes what’s inside that block and moves on with the program. 

Notice that if we did not use this error handling structure, that program will terminate as soon as the error occurs.

**Example**

Below is a simple example of a try/except structure. In this program we are expecting a number as input from the user. Once some input is provided, the program will try to convert that into and integer value. It is actually the risky operation. Because we can not guarantee that the user will provide a number. 

For example the user can provide a string or just input nothing at all. In such a case, the program will have a problem converting anything other than a number to integer. In normal circumstances, the program will complain about the issue and terminate. But in our example, in such a problematic situation, the program will jump to the except block and assign the value -1 to the variable num_val. So it will prevent ungraceful termination of the program.

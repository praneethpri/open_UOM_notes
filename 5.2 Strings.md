## Strings in Python

Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes ' ' the same as double quotes " ".

Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable. For example:

var1 = 'Hello World!’  
var2 = "Python Programming"

Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *. This is another way to create new strings. For example:

Two string literals next to each other are automatically concatenated. The first line above could also have been written word = 'Help' 'A'  this only works with two literals, not with arbitrary string expressions.

## Accessing Elements and Slicing

Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring. Individual elements can be accessed with an index. Substrings can be specified with the slice notation: two indices separated by a colon.

Some examples:

Slice indices have useful defaults: an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.

Indices may be negative numbers, to start counting from the right. Continuing from previous example:

**Can We Update Strings?**

Python strings are immutable, i.e., cannot be changed. Assigning to an indexed position in a string results in an error, as shown below.

However, creating a new string with the combined content is easy and efficient, as shown below.

Strings are immutable does not mean we cannot assign a new (separate) string “xyz” to an existing variable which is now assigned a string “pqr”. That means, we can "update" an existing variable, which now has a string value, by (re)assigning it another string. The new value can be related to its previous value or to a completely different string altogether. The following explains this.

**String Special Operators**

Assume variable a holds 'Hello' and variable b holds 'Python', then:

+ Operator: Concatenation - Adds values on either side of the operator

> > > a + b  
> > > HelloPython

* Operator: Repetition - Creates new strings, concatenating multiple copies of the same string

> > > a*2  
> > > HelloHello

[ ] : Slice - Gives the character from the given index

> > > a[1]  
> > > e

[ : ]: Range Slice - Gives the characters from the given range

> > > a[1:4]  
> > > ell

in: Membership - Returns true if a character exists in the given string

> > > H in a  
> > > True

not in: Membership - Returns true if a character does not exist in the given string

> > > M not in a  
> > > True

r/R

Raw String - Suppresses actual meaning of Escape characters. The syntax for raw strings is exactly the same as for normal strings with the exception of the raw string operator, the letter "r," which precedes the quotation marks. The "r" can be lowercase (r) or uppercase (R) and must be placed immediately preceding the first quote mark. 

> > > print (r'\n')  
> > > \n  

> > > print (R'\n')  
> > > \n

%: Format - Performs String formatting

See next section

**String Formatting Operator %**

One of Python's most useful features is the string format operator % (which we have used before). This operator is unique to strings. The following is an example. 

> > > print("My name is %s and I am %d years old!" % ('Kumar', 20)) 

My name is Kumar and I am 20 years old!

Here is the list of complete set of symbols which can be used along with %:

**Format Symbol**    **Conversion**

%c                         character

%s                         string conversion via str() prior to formatting

%i                          signed decimal integer

%d                         signed decimal integer

%u                         unsigned decimal integer

%o                         octal integer

%x                         hexadecimal integer (lowercase letters) 

%X                        hexadecimal integer (UPPERcase letters) 

%e                        hexadecimal integer (UPPERcase letters) 

%E                        exponential notation (with UPPERcase 'E')

%f                         exponential notation (with UPPERcase 'E')

%g                        the shorter of %f and %e

%G                       the shorter of %f and %E
